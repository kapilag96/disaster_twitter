# Disaster management using information aggregated from twitter
Microsoft CodeFunDo++ 2018

## Idea

People use platforms like Twitter to share the minutia of their everyday lives. We can exploit this during a disaster when every bit of information is pivotal. Such aggregated information can be vastly more detailed than can be collected by various agencies. We can get a much clearer picture of the reality on the ground.

Twitter's API allows us to make requests for tweets within a area. It allows us to specify latitudes, longitudes, radius etc. We can enter specific location to search for all the tweets made in and around the disaster zone or we can feed such a system a set of hashtags that can be used to pull all such tweets. For example, during hurricane irma, #hurricaneirma, #irma tags would allow us to collect all relevant tweets. We can then use Natural Language Processing to sort the tweet into many buckets. Each bucket of tweet can have a set of actions prescribed to it. For example, tweets that contain the information about injured people can be sent to paramedics/ firemen or tweets about relief camps or people willing to host can be sent to victims of the disaster.

Possible uses of information collected -
1. Find users willing to donate or volunteer and connect them to the corresponding organizations.
2. Collect reports of the on the ground reality in a disaster zone e.g. severed utility lines, electrified areas of water, gas leaks and share this information with other users and emergency service providers.
3. Find people in need of help and direct emergency personnel in their direction.
4. Collect information of missing and found people so that they can be reunited with their families.
